      <description>This has been the longest I&amp;rsquo;ve ever spent on a /blog.
Starting from learning an entirely new photo editing workflow to building an entire website for it to searching for a new image host (and also the post-holiday procrastination phase but shh).

Plus, my Jekyll sites are always so hacked together to achieve what I want that the original theme code no longer salvageable. I just want to start fresh.</description>
